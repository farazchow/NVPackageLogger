            A few things to be aware of...
            <br />
            <br />
            - New Vassar Desk cannot directly forward packages (other than
            USPS), and we cannot forward mail internationally (so if you will be
            living internationally, please provide a C/O residing in the US if
            possible).
            <br />
            - In general, if you want your mail to be forwarded to someone who
            is not you or you would like to authorize your mail pick up to
            someone who is not you, include "C/O Firstname Lastname".
            <br />
            - Directly call Ganatra at (𝟐𝟓𝟔) 𝟐𝟓𝟖-𝟗𝟔𝟑𝟎 or email out to the desk
            supervisors' mailing list 𝐧𝐯-𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐤@𝐦𝐢𝐭.𝐞𝐝𝐮 if you have any questions
            concerning this form.

            one-off mail/package pickup, if you wish to confirm/denote
            authorization for someone else to pickup (or be forwarded) your mail
